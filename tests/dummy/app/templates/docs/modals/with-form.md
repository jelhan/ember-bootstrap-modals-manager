# Modal With Form

Let's create a modal with form. It'll be a component called `modal-with-form`.

Any modal that extends `components/modals-container/base` can be managed with `modals-manager`:

{{#docs-snippet name="skeleton-for-new-modal-js" title="Skeleton for the new Modal (JS)"}}
import BaseModal from './modals-container/base';

export default class ModalWithForm extends BaseModal {
  
}
{{/docs-snippet}}

{{#docs-snippet name="skeleton-for-new-modal-hbs" title="Skeleton for the new Modal (HBS)"}}
<BsModal
  @open={{modalIsOpened}}
  @onSubmit={{fn this.confirm}}
  @onHide={{fn this.decline}}
as |modal|>
  <modal.header />
  <modal.body />
  <modal.footer />
</BsModal>
{{/docs-snippet}}

Attribute `modalIsOpened` is declared in the `Base`-modal. It's value is set in the modals-manager and represents modal's state (is it opened or closed). Action handlers `confirm` and `decline` are used to "proceed" modal. Both of them are also declared in the `Base`-modal. Confirmation can be done by clicking on "confirm" button (e.g. 'OK', 'Yes', 'Confirm' etc). Any other modal-closing is going to be processed as "decline".

Footer for modal is going to by like this:

{{#docs-snippet name="modal-footer-hbs" title="Modal's footer"}}
<modal.footer>
  <BsButton @onClick=modal.close @type="default">Cancel</BsButton>
  <BsButton @onClick=modal.submit @type="success">Create</BsButton>
</modal.footer>
{{/docs-snippet}}

It has two buttons - Create and Cancel. First one is 'Confirm' and second one is 'Decline'. Click-handlers for them are taken from `modal`-hash.

Finally let's add a form to the modal's body. It's going to be not a simple form and a form with validations. So, extra addon called `ember-bootstrap-cp-validations` is used. It can be installed with next command:
 
{{#docs-snippet name="install-ember-bootstrap-cp-validations"}}
ember i ember-bootstrap-cp-validations
{{/docs-snippet}}
 
Forms in the `ember-bootstrap` require `model`-property. It can be a model from your application or any other object. Let's create a property `formData` in the component `modal-with-form`:
 
{{#docs-snippet name="form-data-property" title="Property formData"}}
import BaseModal from './modals-container/base';
import {validator, buildValidations} from 'ember-cp-validations';
import EmberObject, {computed} from '@ember/object';
import {getOwner} from '@ember/application';

export default class ModalWithForm extends BaseModal {

  @computed()
  get formData () {
    const Validations = buildValidations({
      firstName: validator('presence', true),
      lastName: validator('presence', true),
      email: [
        validator('presence', true),
        validator('format', {
          type: 'email'
        })
      ]
    });
    return EmberObject
      .extend(Validations, {})
      .create(getOwner(this).ownerInjection());
  })
}
{{/docs-snippet}}

Here validations are added "in-place" where object is defined. More about validations is in the [ember-cp-validations#docs](http://offirgolan.github.io/ember-cp-validations/docs/modules/Basic.html#a-note-on-testing--object-containers).

Modal's body with form is:
 
{{#docs-snippet name="modal-body-with-form" title="Modal's body with form"}}
<modal.body>
  <BsForm
    @model={{formData}}
    @novalidate={{true}}
    @onSubmit={{fn this.confirm}}
  as |form|>
    <form.element
      @property="firstName"
      @label="First Name"/>
    <form.element
      @property="lastName"
      @label="Last Name"/>
    <form.element
      @property="email"
      @label="Email"/>
  </BsForm>
</modal.body>
{{/docs-snippet}}

Form has three inputs for fields `firstName`, `lastName` and `email`. All of them are described in the `formData` and has validation requirements.

**Important** `onSubmit`-handler is `(action "confirm")` and not `modal.submit`!  

Full component's code is bellow. You can check how it works on {{#link-to "demo"}}demo page{{/link-to}}. 

{{docs-snippet name="components-modal-with-form.js" title="components/modal-with-form.js"}}

{{docs-snippet name="components-modal-with-form.hbs" title="templates/components/modal-with-form.hbs"}}

> Form from `modal.body` can be moved to the separated component. In this case "submit"-handler should be passed on it and `formData` should be declared in the new form-component and not in the modal.

Last question is how to use this modal with `modals-manager`? It can be used with method `show`:
 
{{#docs-snippet name="modal-with-form-usage" title="Using of created modal"}}
import Controller from '@ember/controller';
import {action, get} from '@ember/object';
import {inject as service} from '@ember/service';

export default class ModalWithFormDemoController extends Controller {
  @service()
  modalsManager;
  
  @action
  showModalWithForm() {
    return get(this, 'modalsManager')
      .show('modal-with-form')
      .then(formValues => {
        // form is submitted
        // here `formValues` is an object with values from inputs
      })
      .catch(() => {
        // modal is closed without submit
      });
  }
}
{{/docs-snippet}}
